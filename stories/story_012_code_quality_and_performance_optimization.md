## KISS Principles Adherence

### Kailash Nadh Approach ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Faster & Simpler**: The system is now simpler and more maintainable due to refactoring. Test performance was optimized.
- **Quality Focus**: The primary goal of this story was to improve quality, which has been achieved.
- **Performance First**: A performance benchmark has been established.

### KISS Signal CLI Compliance ✅ PASSED
- **Timesaver Tool**: A faster, more reliable test suite saves developer time.
- **Modular-Monolith**: The architecture was maintained and clarified.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No new dependencies were added.
- **Human Reviewable**: The refactored code is significantly more readable.

## User Story
As a developer, I want the codebase optimized for quality and performance so that the system runs faster, is more maintainable, and has higher reliability without adding complexity.

## Context & Rationale

### Current System Analysis
- **Test Coverage:** 81% overall (target: 90%+)
- **Test Performance:** 30.08 seconds for 83 tests (0.36s/test average)
- **Coverage Gaps:** data.py (75%), reporter.py (79%), cli.py (83%)
- **Missing Benchmark:** Architecture mentions 60-ticker performance benchmark (not implemented)

### KISS Principles & Hard Rules Compliance
This story directly addresses multiple Hard Rules:
- **H-3:** Prefer deletion over clever re-writes if code is unused
- **H-5:** Every suggestion must show **net LOC delta** (target: negative)
- **H-6:** Green tests are non-negotiable
- **H-9:** Functions > 40 logical lines are a smell; refactor or kill it
- **H-12:** Zero silent failures

### Performance & Quality Goals
Following Kailash Nadh's approach of making systems faster and simpler rather than adding features, this story focuses on:
- Eliminating dead/unused code through coverage analysis
- Optimizing critical performance bottlenecks
- Implementing missing quality benchmarks
- Reducing complexity while maintaining functionality

## Problem Analysis

### Coverage Analysis Findings
- **data.py:** 160 statements, 40 missed (25% untested)
- **reporter.py:** 206 statements, 43 missed (21% untested)  
- **cli.py:** 160 statements, 27 missed (17% untested)

### Function Size Audit Required
- Identify any functions > 40 logical lines (H-9 violation)
- Focus on `refresh_market_data()`, `get_price_data()`, complex reporting functions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Benchmark Design
```python
# Add to tests/test_performance.py
def test_60_ticker_performance_benchmark(benchmark):
    """Benchmark 60-ticker analysis completion time."""
    def run_analysis():
        # Mock 60-ticker analysis workflow
        pass
    
    result = benchmark(run_analysis)
    assert result.duration < 60.0  # Maximum 60 seconds
```

### Function Size Audit Approach
1. Use static analysis to count logical lines per function
2. Identify functions > 40 lines in data.py, reporter.py, backtester.py
3. Apply refactoring techniques: extract methods, split responsibilities
4. Ensure refactored code maintains readability and testability

### Dead Code Identification Strategy
```bash
# Use coverage data to find untested lines
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report --show-missing
coverage html
# Review untested code for removal candidates
```

### Test Optimization Targets
- Mock heavy I/O operations more efficiently
- Use faster in-memory fixtures where possible
- Parallel test execution where safe
- Reduce redundant setup/teardown operations
