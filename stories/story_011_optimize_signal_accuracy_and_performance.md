## User Story
As a developer, I want a simple, lightweight performance monitoring utility integrated into the CLI so that I can profile long-running operations and identify performance bottlenecks without adding complex dependencies.

## Context & Rationale
To maintain and improve the application's performance as new features are added, a lightweight, built-in profiling tool is necessary. This aligns with NFR-1 (performance target < 30s) and provides a foundation for future optimization work. The goal is to add this capability with minimal code and zero new external dependencies, adhering to KISS principles.

This story also resolves technical debt by removing a previously added `psutil` dependency, which violated project rules, and simplifying the performance monitor to focus solely on execution time.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ AC-1: Performance Monitoring Module
- [x] A new `performance.py` module is created.
- [x] It contains a `PerformanceMonitor` class to track execution time.
- [x] It provides a `@profile_performance` decorator for easy function profiling.
- [x] It provides a `monitor_execution` context manager for profiling code blocks.

### ✅ AC-2: CLI Integration
- [x] The main `run` command in `cli.py` is wrapped with the `monitor_execution` context manager to profile the entire analysis pipeline.
- [x] When run with `--verbose`, the CLI prints a performance summary at the end of the run, showing total duration and the slowest function.

### ✅ AC-3: Backtester Integration
- [x] The `backtester.find_optimal_strategies` method is decorated with `@profile_performance` to track its specific performance.

### ✅ AC-4: Code Quality & Testing
- [x] The new module has comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_performance.py`.
- [x] The implementation has 100% type hint coverage and passes `mypy --strict`.
- [x] The implementation adds no new external dependencies, using only standard libraries.

## Definition of Done
- [x] `performance.py` module is implemented and tested.
- [x] Performance monitoring is integrated into the CLI and backtester.
- [x] The `--verbose` flag correctly displays a time-based performance summary.
- [x] The `psutil` dependency and all memory-monitoring code have been removed.
- [x] All tests pass, and `mypy --strict` passes.
- [x] The implementation adheres to all project hard rules, especially H-10 (no new dependencies).
