# Story 011: Optimize Signal Accuracy and Performance Enhancement

## Status: 🚧 READY FOR DEVELOPMENT

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Story Points:** 21  
**Prerequisites:** Story 010 (Architectural Debt Remediation) ✅ Complete  
**Created:** 2025-06-28  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-28  

## User Story
As a trader using the KISS Signal CLI, I want improved signal accuracy and faster performance so that I receive more reliable trading recommendations in under 30 seconds and can trust the system's edge score calculations to identify truly profitable strategies.

## Context & Rationale

### Current System State (Post Story 010)
The architectural debt remediation has established a solid foundation:
- ✅ **Clean Architecture:** All critical architectural flaws resolved
- ✅ **Baseline + Layers Strategy:** Implemented per PRD specifications
- ✅ **Code Quality:** 81% test coverage across 855 statements
- ✅ **Feature Parity:** Backtester correctly implements strategy discovery
- ✅ **Clean Dependencies:** Single source of truth in `pyproject.toml`

### Performance & Quality Gaps Identified
Despite architectural improvements, analysis of test results and system performance reveals opportunities for optimization:

1. **Signal Quality Issues:** Current test coverage shows gaps in edge cases that could produce false signals
2. **Performance Bottlenecks:** 112.49s test runtime suggests potential optimization opportunities  
3. **Coverage Gaps:** Several modules below 90% coverage indicating untested edge cases
4. **Strategy Discovery Refinement:** Need better filtering and ranking of strategies

### Business Impact
- **Trading Performance:** Better signal accuracy = higher profitability
- **User Experience:** Faster execution = better adoption and usability
- **Risk Management:** More robust edge cases = fewer false positives
- **Scalability:** Performance improvements enable larger universe analysis

## Problem Analysis
