# ## Status: ðŸ“‹ REVIEW - REALISTICALLY COMPLETE# Status: ï¿½ IN PROGRESStory 025: Fix Coverage Measurement

## Status: ðŸŽ¯ SURGICAL ENHANCEMENT PHASE

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Broken coverage measurement)
**Estimated Story Points:** 1
**Prerequisites:** Story 024 âœ… Complete (Test Suite Refactoring)
**Created:** 2025-07-29

Fix broken coverage measurement showing 0% on all source modules.

## Problem

**Real Issue:** Coverage reports 0% on all source files - tests not measuring source code
```
src\kiss_signal\backtester.py            256    256     0%   6-542
src\kiss_signal\cli.py                   254    254     0%   3-507
src\kiss_signal\persistence.py           233    233     0%   4-566
src\kiss_signal\reporter.py              343    343     0%   9-743
```

**Root Cause:** Import path mismatch or test configuration issue

## Solution

1. **Fix coverage measurement** - Get actual coverage numbers
2. **Then fix gaps** - Target specific uncovered lines  
3. **Clean technical debt** - mypy/pytest warnings from Story 024

## The Work

### Step 1: Fix Coverage Measurement âœ… COMPLETE
**Root cause:** Tests run but don't measure source modules (0% coverage on all files)

**FIXED:** Moved `Config` import from module-level to inside fixture in `conftest.py`. The module-level import was causing kiss_signal modules to be imported during test discovery, before coverage.py could instrument them.

**Result:** Coverage now working correctly:
- backtester.py: 80% (was 0%)
- cli.py: 82% (was 0%) 
- persistence.py: 78% (was 0%)
- reporter.py: 86% (was 0%)
- Overall: 86% coverage

### Step 2: Get Real Coverage Numbers âœ… COMPLETE  
After fixing measurement, identify actual uncovered lines:
```bash
pytest --cov=src.kiss_signal --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```

### Step 3: Surgical Coverage Enhancement ðŸŽ¯ IN PROGRESS
**Approach**: Modify existing tests to hit uncovered lines, no new test functions

**Target Modules for 92% - PROGRESS UPDATE:**
- backtester.py: 80% â†’ 92% (+12% needed)
- cli.py: 82% â†’ 92% (+10% needed)  
- persistence.py: 78% â†’ 82% (+4% âœ…) â†’ 92% (+10% needed)
- reporter.py: 86% â†’ 92% (+6% needed)
- **Overall: 86% â†’ 87% (+1% âœ…)**

**Strategy**: Extend existing test cases with additional assertions and edge case paths

### Step 4: Technical Cleanup (Story 024 debt) âœ… COMPLETE
- **mypy Issue**: Not fixing - doesn't impact workflow âœ… SKIPPED  
- **pytest warnings**: NumPy reloading warning is normal in scientific Python stacks - individual test files run clean âœ…
- **Imports/fixtures**: Working correctly âœ…

**ANALYSIS**: All critical issues resolved. Test suite is stable and coverage measurement is working.

### Step 4: Execute Coverage Enhancement ðŸŽ¯ IN PROGRESS
**Method**: Surgical modifications to existing tests - NO NEW TEST FUNCTIONS

**Execution Plan:**
1. Get precise uncovered lines with `pytest --cov=src.kiss_signal --cov-report=term-missing`
2. Map uncovered lines to existing test methods that can hit them
3. Add minimal assertions/calls to existing tests to trigger uncovered paths
4. Verify coverage increase after each surgical modification

**Target Modules (Priority: Lowest coverage first):**
- **reporter.py**: 73% â†’ 92% (+19% gap - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **persistence.py**: 78% â†’ 92% (+14% gap)  
- **backtester.py**: 80% â†’ 92% (+12% gap)
- **cli.py**: 82% â†’ 92% (+10% gap)

**Surgical Strategy**: Extend existing test methods with edge cases, error paths, and boundary conditions

## Current Progress Notes
