# Story 010: Architectural Debt Remediation and Core Infrastructure Cleanup

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Story Points:** 13  
**Prerequisites:** Story 009 (Implement Position Tracking) âœ… Complete  
**Created:** 2025-06-26  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-26  

### Critical Architectural Review Context
This story addresses **four critical architectural flaws** identified in the 2025-07-09 baseline architectural audit (`arch_review.md`). These flaws represent fundamental integrity issues that must be resolved to maintain the project's architectural health and prevent further technical debt accumulation.

### Implementation Summary
- **Dead Code Removed:** Deleted `src/kiss_signal/adapters/yfinance_adapter.py` and its tests, as it was a duplicate of logic in `data.py`.
- **Backtester Feature Implemented:** The backtester now correctly implements the `baseline` + `layers` strategy discovery mechanism as specified in the PRD. It tests the baseline rule alone, then tests the baseline combined with each layer, and ranks the results.
- **Architecture Documentation Corrected:** `docs/architecture.md` has been updated to reflect the actual codebase. References to non-existent modules (`DataManager`, `SignalGenerator`) have been removed, and the database schema has been corrected to show the `strategies` and `positions` tables with JSON storage for rule definitions.
- **Dependencies Standardized:** The `requirements.txt` file has been deleted, establishing `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth for all project dependencies.
- **Use Cases Updated:** All relevant use cases (`uc_cli.md`, `uc_backtester.md`) have been updated to reflect the new `baseline` + `layers` logic, ensuring documentation-to-code traceability.
- **Test Suite Aligned:** The test suite has been updated to pass with the new architectural changes, ensuring no regressions were introduced.

**Final Status:** All four critical architectural flaws have been resolved. The codebase, documentation, and dependency management are now consistent and aligned.

**Architectural Audit Verdict:** **SYSTEM INTEGRITY DEGRADED** - Critical drift between documentation, requirements, and implementation detected.

## User Story
As a maintainer of the KISS Signal CLI codebase, I want to resolve all critical architectural flaws identified in the baseline audit so that the system has consistent documentation, clean code hygiene, proper dependency management, and feature parity with documented requirements, ensuring long-term maintainability and developer onboarding success.

## Context & Rationale

### Current Architectural Integrity Issues
The baseline architectural audit identified four critical flaws that fundamentally compromise the system's integrity:

1. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Dead Code Pollution** - `yfinance_adapter.py` is duplicate, unused code violating DRY principles
2. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Feature Discrepancy** - Backtester missing core `baseline` + `layers` functionality described in PRD
3. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Documentation Veracity Failure** - `architecture.md` describes non-existent components and wrong database schema
4. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Dependency Hygiene Failure** - Competing dependency lists in `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt`

### Impact on Development Workflow
- **Developer Onboarding:** New developers receive misleading information from `architecture.md`
- **Feature Development:** Core PRD requirements are unimplemented, blocking strategy optimization
- **Code Quality:** Dead code and dependency confusion creates maintenance overhead
- **System Reliability:** Inconsistent dependency management increases security and version conflict risks

### KISS Principles Compliance
This remediation aligns with KISS principles by:
- **Minimalism:** Removing dead code and unnecessary dependencies
- **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminating competing documentation and dependency lists  
- **Transparency:** Making documentation accurately reflect implementation
- **Modularity:** Ensuring backtester implements documented modular strategy testing

## Problem Analysis

### Critical Flaw #1: Architectural Degeneration / Code Hygiene Failure
**Location:** `src/kiss_signal/adapters/yfinance_adapter.py`
**Issue:** Complete duplicate of data fetching logic present in `src/kiss_signal/data.py`
**Evidence:** Module not imported anywhere, `data.py` version has retry logic making it more robust
**Impact:** Violates DRY principle, confuses developers, bloats codebase

### Critical Flaw #2: Critical Feature Discrepancy  
**Location:** `src/kiss_signal/backtester.py` vs `docs/prd.md`
**Issue:** PRD specifies testing rule `layers` on top of `baseline` rule to find optimal combinations
**Evidence:** Current implementation only tests rules in isolation, missing core strategy discovery feature
**Impact:** System fails to deliver key promised functionality, reduces backtester value proposition

### Critical Flaw #3: Documentation Veracity Failure
**Location:** `docs/architecture.md`
**Issue:** Architecture document describes non-existent components and wrong database schema
**Evidence:**
- References non-existent modules like `SignalGenerator` and `DataManager`
- Describes normalized schema with `rule_stack` and `trades` tables using foreign keys
- Actual implementation uses denormalized schema with `strategies` and `positions` tables storing rule definitions as JSON
**Impact:** Actively misleading documentation causes onboarding friction and wrong architectural decisions

### Critical Flaw #4: Dependency Hygiene Failure
**Location:** `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt`
**Issue:** Two competing dependency lists with unused dependencies in `requirements.txt`
**Evidence:** `requirements.txt` contains `python-telegram-bot`, `pandas-ta`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` not in `pyproject.toml`
**Impact:** Bloated environments, security surface area increase, version conflict risks

## Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Dead Code Elimination
- **File:** `src/kiss_signal/adapters/yfinance_adapter.py`
- **Action:** Delete the entire file and directory if empty
- **Verification:** 
  ```bash
  grep -r "yfinance_adapter" src/ tests/
  # Should return no results
  ```

### Task 2: Baseline + Layers Strategy Implementation
- **File:** `src/kiss_signal/backtester.py`
- **Action:** Enhance `find_optimal_strategies()` method to implement layered strategy testing
- **Core Logic:**
  ```python
  # 1. Test baseline strategy alone
  baseline_result = self._backtest_strategy(baseline_rules, price_data)
  
  # 2. Test baseline + each layer
  for layer_name, layer_rules in layers.items():
      combined_strategy = {**baseline_rules, **layer_rules}
      layer_result = self._backtest_strategy(combined_strategy, price_data)
      # Store with rule_stack like "baseline,rsi14_confirm"
  
  # 3. Return best performing combination by edge score
  ```

### Task 3: Rule Configuration Support
- **File:** `config/rules.yaml`
- **Action:** Ensure structure supports `baseline` and `layers` sections as described in PRD
- **Expected Structure:**
  ```yaml
  baseline:
    # Core entry/exit rules
    
  layers:
    rsi14_confirm:
      # Additional conditions
    bull_regime:
      # Market regime filters
  ```

### Task 4: Architecture Documentation Update
- **File:** `docs/architecture.md`
- **Action:** Replace inaccurate sections with current implementation reality
- **Key Updates:**
  - Component diagram showing actual `src/kiss_signal/` modules
  - Database schema matching `persistence.py` CREATE TABLE statements
  - Remove references to non-existent modules
  - Add note about JSON storage in denormalized schema

### Task 5: Dependency Standardization
- **Files:** `requirements.txt` (delete), `pyproject.toml` (update), `README.md` (update)
- **Actions:**
  1. Review `requirements.txt` for any dependencies not in `pyproject.toml`
  2. Add necessary dependencies to `pyproject.toml` [dev] section if needed
  3. Delete `requirements.txt`
  4. Update README installation instructions

### Task 6: Memory Documentation
- **File:** `docs/memory.md`
- **Action:** Add entries documenting architectural decisions and lessons learned
- **Content:**
  ```markdown
