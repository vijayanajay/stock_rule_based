## Story Implementation Details

### Story 001: Project Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE
**Story Points:** 5 | **Priority:** Critical

**Key Decisions:**
- **CLI Framework:** Typer for command-line interface (`quickedge run`)
- **Package Structure:** Modular monolith in `src/kiss_signal/`
- **Configuration:** Pydantic models with YAML config files
- **Quality Gates:** pytest + mypy validation pipeline

**Core Modules Established:**
```
src/kiss_signal/
├── cli.py          # Entry point with quickedge command
├── config.py       # Pydantic models for configuration
├── data.py         # NSE data fetching and caching
├── backtester.py   # Strategy discovery and backtesting
├── rules.py        # Technical analysis rule functions
├── persistence.py  # SQLite database operations
└── reporter.py     # Rich console output and reporting
```

**Configuration Architecture:**
- `config.yaml`: Edge score weights (`win_pct: 0.6`, `sharpe: 0.4`)
- `rules.yaml`: Rule definitions with baseline + layers structure
- Support for `--freeze-data YYYY-MM-DD` for backtesting

**Why This Mattered:** Established the architectural foundation that enabled all subsequent development. The modular monolith approach kept complexity manageable while enabling feature development in parallel.

### Story 002: Data Manager & NSE Data Fetching ✅ COMPLETE  
**Story Points:** 8 | **Priority:** High

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Data Source:** yfinance for NSE equity data (`.NS` suffix handling)
- **Caching Strategy:** CSV files in `data/cache/` with intelligent refresh logic
- **Universe Definition:** `nifty_large_mid.csv` with 20-30 liquid NSE symbols
- **Data Schema:** Standardized OHLCV columns with proper dtype enforcement

**Critical Implementation Details:**
```python
# Standardized DataFrame Schema
columns = ['date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']
dtypes = {
    'date': 'datetime64[ns]',
    'open': 'float64', 'high': 'float64', 'low': 'float64', 
    'close': 'float64', 'volume': 'int64'
}
```

**Performance Requirements Met:**
- Data refresh for 30 symbols: <20 seconds
- Cached data serving: <100ms per symbol
- Network timeout and failure handling

**Freeze Date Implementation:** Prevents data leakage during backtesting by serving only historical data up to specified date.

**Why This Mattered:** Reliable data fetching is the foundation of any trading system. The caching strategy balances data freshness with performance, and the freeze date prevents look-ahead bias in backtesting.

### Story 003: Rule Functions Library ✅ COMPLETE
**Story Points:** 13 | **Priority:** High  

**Core Rule Functions Implemented:**
1. **Trend Following:**
   - `sma_crossover()`: Fast/slow moving average crossover signals
   - `ema_crossover()`: Exponential moving average variant
   - `price_above_sma()`: Price vs moving average position

2. **Momentum Indicators:**
   - `rsi_divergence()`: RSI-based oversold/overbought signals
   - `macd_signal()`: MACD line and signal line crossover
   - `stochastic_oversold()`: Stochastic oscillator signals

3. **Volume Analysis:**
   - `volume_breakout()`: Unusual volume detection
   - `vwap_deviation()`: Volume-weighted average price signals

**Function Signature Standard:**
```python
def rule_function(
    price_data: pd.DataFrame, 
    **params
) -> pd.Series:
    """Returns boolean Series with True for buy signals"""
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Parameter Flexibility:** All periods and thresholds configurable via YAML
- **Vectorized Operations:** pandas/numpy for performance
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with insufficient data
- **Validation:** OHLCV column validation in every function

**Why This Mattered:** The rule library provides the building blocks for strategy construction. The standardized interface allows the backtester to dynamically combine any rules without code changes.

### Story 005: Implement Backtesting Engine ✅ COMPLETE
**Story Points:** 8 | **Priority:** High

**Core Backtesting Architecture:**
- **Framework:** Vectorbt for high-performance backtesting
- **Strategy Discovery:** Automated testing of rule combinations
- **Edge Score Calculation:** Configurable weights for win% and Sharpe ratio
- **Performance Thresholds:** Minimum 10 trades for statistical validity

**Key Implementation Details:**
```python
def find_optimal_strategies(
    self, 
    symbol: str, 
    price_data: pd.DataFrame
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Tests baseline + layer combinations and ranks by edge score"""
```

**Strategy Testing Logic:**
1. Test baseline rule alone
2. Test baseline + each layer combination  
3. Calculate win percentage and Sharpe ratio
4. Rank by configurable edge score formula
5. Filter by minimum trades threshold

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Edge Score:** `(win_pct * 0.6) + (sharpe_ratio * 0.4)` (configurable)
- **Minimum Trades:** 10 trades required for statistical validity
- **Hold Period:** 20-day default (configurable)
- **Alpha Target:** Returns > NIFTY 50 benchmark

**Why This Mattered:** The backtesting engine is the core intelligence of the system. It automatically discovers which rule combinations work best for each stock, removing manual strategy optimization burden from users.

### Story 006: Signal Generation Module ❌ CANCELLED  
**Story Points:** 5 | **Status:** Redundant Implementation

**Cancellation Rationale:** During implementation review, it was discovered that signal generation was already fully implemented within the backtesting engine. Creating a separate module would have introduced unnecessary abstraction and violated KISS principles.

**Functionality Delivered in Backtester:** Entry/exit signal generation, rule combination logic, and signal validation were all incorporated into the backtesting engine for better cohesion.

**Why This Mattered:** Demonstrated the value of iterative development and architectural review. Avoiding redundant code kept the system simple and maintainable.

-- Strategies table: stores backtested strategy performance
CREATE TABLE strategies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    rule_stack TEXT NOT NULL,      -- JSON: ["baseline", "rsi14_confirm"]
    parameters TEXT NOT NULL,       -- JSON: rule parameters
    win_percentage REAL NOT NULL,
    sharpe_ratio REAL NOT NULL,
    edge_score REAL NOT NULL,
    total_trades INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Positions table: stores actual trading signals and outcomes
CREATE TABLE positions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    strategy_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    entry_date DATE NOT NULL,
    exit_date DATE,
    entry_price REAL NOT NULL,
    exit_price REAL,
