# Story: CLI Integration and Error Handling Enhancement

## Description
As the final component to complete the MEQSAP core pipeline, we need to enhance the CLI module with comprehensive error handling, user-friendly messaging, and robust command-line argument processing. This story focuses on creating a polished, production-ready command-line interface that integrates all previously developed modules (config, data, backtest, reporting) into a seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete CLI interface supports all required command-line flags (`--report`, `--verbose`, `--version`, etc.)
2. Comprehensive error handling provides clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
3. User-friendly output formatting with appropriate logging levels and colored console output
4. Robust configuration file validation with specific error messages for common mistakes
5. Data acquisition errors are handled gracefully with helpful troubleshooting suggestions
6. Backtest execution errors provide clear diagnostics and recovery suggestions
7. Version information displays tool version and key dependency versions
8. Progress indicators for long-running operations (data download, backtest execution)
9. Dry-run mode allows configuration validation without executing backtest
10. Exit codes follow standard conventions for integration with scripts and CI/CD

## Implementation Details

**Status: Review** - All tasks completed, comprehensive CLI implementation ready for final approval.

All acceptance criteria have been met and the implementation follows the project's architectural principles and coding standards.

## Exit Code Strategy

The CLI uses a comprehensive exit code system to enable precise error diagnosis:

- **0**: Success - Analysis completed without errors
- **1**: Configuration Error - Invalid config file, missing parameters, validation failures
- **2**: Data Error - Data acquisition failures, missing data, format issues
- **3**: Backtest Error - Strategy execution failures, calculation errors
- **4**: Report Error - Output generation failures, file system issues
- **5**: Unexpected Error - Unhandled exceptions, system errors, programming bugs

This refined strategy ensures that:
- CI/CD pipelines can accurately determine failure categories
- Scripts can implement category-specific retry logic
- Debugging is accelerated through precise error classification
- No exit code collisions between error categories

## Error Propagation & Logging

All unhandled exceptions are:
1. Logged with full tracebacks using `logging.exception()`
2. Wrapped with descriptive error messages via `_generate_error_message()`
3. Assigned the appropriate exit code (5 for unexpected errors)
4. Presented consistently through the CLI's error formatting system

This ensures comprehensive error visibility in both interactive and non-interactive environments.
