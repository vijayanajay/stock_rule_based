# Duplicate Rules Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem Addressed
Fixed duplicate rule configuration files that existed at:
- Root level: `rules.yaml` 
- Config directory: `config/rules.yaml`

This duplication caused:
- Conflicting validation ranges between files
- Non-deterministic behavior depending on which file was loaded
- Potential configuration drift during development

## Specific Conflicts Resolved

### Validation Range Inconsistencies
- **fast_period**: Root had `min: 5`, config had `min: 2`
- **slow_period**: Root had `min: 10`, config had `min: 5`  
- **period**: Root had `min: 5`, config had `min: 2`

### Structural Differences
- Root file: Embedded validation within each rule definition
- Config file: Centralized validation section + per-rule validation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Canonical File Selection ‚úÖ
- Chose `config/rules.yaml` as the single canonical source
- Merged best practices from both files into consolidated format
- Standardized on higher minimum values for robustness:
  - `fast_period: {min: 5, max: 50}`
  - `slow_period: {min: 10, max: 200}`
  - `period: {min: 5, max: 50}`

### 2. File Cleanup ‚úÖ
- Removed root-level `rules.yaml` to eliminate duplication
- Updated CLI default path from `"rules.yaml"` to `"config/rules.yaml"`

### 3. Test Suite Updates ‚úÖ
- Updated all test files to use `config/rules.yaml` path
- Fixed syntax errors introduced during path updates
- All 62 tests passing successfully

### 4. CI Prevention Mechanism ‚úÖ
- Created `scripts/check_duplicate_rules.py` to detect multiple rule files
- Added `check_rules.bat` for easy Windows execution
- CI check fails if multiple rule configuration files detected
- Verified check works correctly

### 5. Documentation ‚úÖ
- Updated `docs/memory.md` with detailed issue description and prevention
- Created this summary for future reference

## Verification Results

### Tests ‚úÖ
- All 62 tests passing
- CLI tests updated to use canonical path
- Type checks (MyPy) passing with no issues

### CLI Functionality ‚úÖ 
- Help shows correct default: `[default: config/rules.yaml]`
- CLI runs successfully with new path
- Freeze mode works correctly

### CI Check ‚úÖ
```
üîç Checking for duplicate rule configuration files...
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Single canonical rule file found: config\rules.yaml
```

## KISS Compliance ‚úÖ

- **Tiny Diff**: < 25 LOC per change, focused edits
- **Module Boundaries**: Kept changes within proper files
- **No New Deps**: Used only existing tools and libraries
- **Quality Gate**: All tests pass, MyPy clean, CLI functional

## Future Prevention

1. Always run `check_rules.bat` before commits
2. Keep rule configs only in `config/` directory  
3. Use CI check in automated pipelines
4. Reference `docs/memory.md` for similar issues

## Files Modified

- `config/rules.yaml` - Consolidated canonical rules file
- `src/kiss_signal/cli.py` - Updated default rules path
- `tests/test_cli.py` - Updated test file paths
- `scripts/check_duplicate_rules.py` - New CI check script
- `check_rules.bat` - Windows batch wrapper
- `docs/memory.md` - Added prevention documentation
- Removed: `rules.yaml` (root level duplicate)

‚úÖ **Status: COMPLETE - Single canonical rules file established with CI prevention**
