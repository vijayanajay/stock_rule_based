### Typer's `exists=True` Path Validation with `isolated_filesystem` (2025-06-15)
**Issue**: CLI tests using `runner.isolated_filesystem()` failed with `UsageError` (exit code 2) when `typer.Option` for `Path` types used `exists=True`.
**Root Cause**: A structural interaction issue where Typer's `exists=True` validation for `Path` options could occur relative to the test runner's initial CWD, *before* `isolated_filesystem()` changed the CWD for the command's execution. If default relative paths were used, this validation would fail as the files only existed in the (not-yet-active) isolated directory.
**Fix**: Removed `exists=True` from the `typer.Option` definitions in `cli.py`. File existence is now checked explicitly within the command's logic, after `isolated_filesystem()` has established the correct CWD.
**Prevention**: When using `typer.Option` with `Path` types and testing with utilities that modify the CWD (like `runner.isolated_filesystem()`), avoid relying on Typer's `exists=True` for path validation if using relative default paths. Instead, perform explicit path existence checks within the command's implementation to ensure validation occurs against the correct runtime CWD. This makes the CLI more robust to CWD changes common in testing scenarios.
