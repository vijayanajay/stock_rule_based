## Part 1: Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates & Identification of New Critical Flaws

### A. Compliance Audit of `arch_review.md` Directives

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**

**Current Status:** RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**

The documentation is now fully aligned with the current codebase.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):** None.
