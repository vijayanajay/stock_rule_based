## Part 1: Audit of Prior Architectural Mandates & Identification of New Critical Flaws

### A. Compliance Audit of `arch_review.md` Directives

**-- AUDIT OF PRIOR DIRECTIVE --**
**Directive Reference (from arch_review.md):** Documentation Veracity Failure (ID: DOC-VERACITY-20250709)
**Current Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Evidence & Justification for Status:**
    The `docs/architecture.md` file has been partially corrected. The "Component View" and "Database Schema" sections now accurately reflect the current codebase (e.g., showing `data.py` instead of `DataManager`, and the correct denormalized schema).
    However, the "Project Structure" section is still out of sync with reality. It incorrectly lists the following obsolete files:
    - `src/kiss_signal/data_manager.py`
    - `src/kiss_signal/signal_generator.py`
    These files do not exist in the current codebase and must be removed from the documentation to prevent confusion.
**Required Action (If Not Fully Resolved/Regressed):**
    The "Project Structure" section in `docs/architecture.md` must be updated to remove all references to `data_manager.py` and `signal_generator.py`. The documentation must be 100% aligned with the actual file structure in the `src/` directory.

## Part 2: Strategic Architectural Imperatives

None.

## Part 3: Actionable Technical Debt Rectification

None.

## Part 4: Audit Conclusion & Next Steps Mandate

 1.  **Critical Path to Compliance:**
    The single remaining task is to correct the "Project Structure" section in `docs/architecture.md`. This is a low-effort, high-impact fix to ensure documentation integrity.
 2.  **System Integrity Verdict:** **IMPROVED**. The system's architectural integrity has significantly improved. Three of the four critical flaws from the previous audit have been fully resolved. The codebase is cleaner, core features align with requirements, and dependency management is standardized. The only remaining issue is a minor documentation inaccuracy.
3.  **`arch_review.md` Update Instruction:** This document serves as the `arch_review.md` for the next audit cycle.
4.  **`resolved_issues.md` Maintenance Confirmation:** `resolved_issues.md` has been updated with entries for the three newly resolved issues.
