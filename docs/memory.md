# KISS Signal CLI - Memory & Learning Log

## Test Suite Desynchronization: Parameter Validation and Data Contract Changes (2025-07-31)
- **Issue**: Three test failures were traced to test expectations that were out of sync with the current application behavior after parameter validation refactoring. Tests expected ValueError for missing parameters when rules have defaults, DataFrame column duplication caused Series/- **Prevention**: Use framework-provided fixtures (like `tmp_path`) for resource management over manual implementations to avoid platform-specific issues like file locking.

## Test Harness Integrity: Configuration and Fixture Desynchronization (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: A large number of test failures in the `reporter` and `backtester` modules were caused by a structural desynchronization between the test suite and the application code. This included:
    1.  **API Contract Drift**: Function signatures (e.g., `_apply_context_filters`, `generate_daily_report`) were modified in the implementation without updating test calls, leading to `TypeError`.
    2.  **Incomplete Refactoring**: A data-fetching helper (`_get_market_data_cached`) was removed from the backtester, but tests continued to patch it, creating "zombie tests" that failed with `AttributeError`.
    3.  **Brittle Tests**: Some tests used incorrect assertion patterns (alphabetical vs. score-based ordering) or were not self-contained (CLI help test), making them fragile.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The test suite, a first-class consumer of the application's API, was not maintained in lockstep with refactoring efforts. This broke the API contract between tests and the application, eroding the test suite's reliability.
- **Fix**: A comprehensive cleanup was performed:
    1.  Corrected the function signatures in all failing test calls to match their required data contracts.
    2.  Removed patches for non-existent methods.
    3.  Refactored brittle tests to use robust assertion patterns and valid mocks (e.g., correcting result ordering, making CLI tests self-contained).
- **Lesson**: The test suite must be treated as a first-class consumer of the application's API. Any refactoring or signature change is incomplete until the corresponding tests are updated or removed. Maintaining test-code synchronization is critical to prevent architectural drift and ensure the test suite remains a reliable safety net.

## Test Harness Integrity: Flawed Invocation and Resource Leaks (2025-07-22)aFrame type mismatch, and tests expected "graceful handling" of invalid rules when proper fail-fast validation was implemented.
- **Structural Root Cause**: API contract desynchronization between test suite and application code. This is a repeat of the "Test Suite Desynchronization" pattern where tests continue to validate old behavior after refactoring. The tests weren't updated when the backtester's parameter validation was simplified to remove overly strict checks (documented in the previous memory entry). Additionally, test data had both 'Close' and 'close' columns, violating the data contract when column normalization creates duplicates.
- **Fix**: 
  1. Updated `test_generate_signals_missing_parameters` to verify that rules with default parameters work correctly with empty params, and test error handling for invalid parameters instead
  2. Fixed `test_find_signals_filters_index_symbol_parameter` to use consistent column naming, removing duplicate 'close'/'Close' columns that caused DataFrame return instead of Series
  3. Updated `test_find_signals_rule_function_error` to expect proper ValueError for non-existent rules instead of "graceful handling" which would mask programming errors
- **Lesson**: When refactoring changes application behavior (even internal API changes), the test suite MUST be updated simultaneously to match the new contract. Tests are first-class consumers of the codebase and must stay synchronized. Data contracts in tests must be consistent with application expectations - avoid column name patterns that cause conflicts during normalization. Proper error handling means failing fast for invalid inputs, not "graceful handling" that masks real errors.

## Parameter Validation Logic: Overly Strict Validation Blocks Valid Use Cases (2025-07-31)
- **Issue**: The backtester's `_generate_signals()` method contained overly strict parameter validation that rejected any rule with empty parameters (`if not rule_params: raise ValueError`). This prevented legitimate use cases where rules have optional parameters with defaults (e.g., `engulfing_pattern` with `min_body_ratio: float = 1.2`). Additionally, inconsistent column naming contracts between test data (`'Close'`) and rule expectations (`'close'`) caused KeyError failures, and empty DataFrames weren't handled gracefully.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The validation logic made the flawed architectural assumption that ALL rules must have explicit parameters, not understanding the difference between rules that require parameters vs. rules with optional defaults. This violated the principle of least surprise and blocked valid function calls that Python would naturally handle. Data contracts between modules were inconsistent, and edge cases like empty DataFrames caused unnecessary processing failures.
- **Fix**: 
  1. Removed the blanket parameter validation check (`if not rule_params: raise ValueError`) and let Python's natural parameter validation handle missing required parameters with specific error messages
  2. Added column name normalization to lowercase for consistent data contracts across modules (`price_data_normalized.columns = price_data_normalized.columns.str.lower()`)
  3. Added early return for empty DataFrames to prevent unnecessary processing (`if price_data.empty: return pd.Series(dtype=bool, name='signals')`)
  4. Fixed test parameter names to match actual function signatures (`threshold` â†’ `oversold_threshold`)
- **Lesson**: Parameter validation should be precise, not blanket restrictions. Trust Python's built-in parameter validation for function calls - it provides better error messages and naturally handles optional parameters. Data contracts between modules must be consistent, especially for column naming conventions. When validation logic prevents legitimate use cases, the validation is wrong, not the use case. Edge cases like empty data should be handled gracefully at module boundaries.

Data contracts between modules must be consistent, especially for column naming conventions. When validation logic prevents legitimate use cases, the validation is wrong, not the use case.

## Test Harness Integrity: Logger Name Mismatch (2025-07-30)
- **Issue**: A suite of 11 tests in `test_adapters.py` consistently failed because they were unable to capture any log messages from the `yfinance` adapter.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The test harness was instrumented to listen on the logger `'src.kiss_signal.adapters.yfinance'`, a name derived from the file path. However, the application code uses `logging.getLogger(__name__)`, which resolves to the canonical Python package name `'kiss_signal.adapters.yfinance'`. This mismatch meant the test's log handler was attached to a logger the application never used, making the tests "deaf" to the system's actual output.
- **Fix**: The logger name in the test setup (`setup_method` and `teardown_method` in `test_adapters.py`) was corrected to use the canonical package name, re-establishing the connection between the test harness and the system under test.
- **Lesson**: Test instrumentation must be precisely aligned with the application's runtime behavior, not filesystem paths. Canonical logger names (`package.module`) are the correct contract for testing, not source tree paths (`src.package.module`). When tests for side-effects like logging fail, first verify the instrumentation is correctly attached to the component being tested.

## Monstrous Function Deletion: SRP Violation in Persistence Layer (2025-07-25)
- **Issue**: The `clear_and_recalculate_strategies` function in `persistence.py` was a 69-line monster that violated the Single Responsibility Principle by doing database operations, data loading, backtesting logic, and orchestration - all in a persistence module that should only handle database operations.
- **Structural Root Cause**: Dead code left behind after CLI refactoring. The CLI was already properly using `clear_strategies_for_config` for clearing and helper functions `_run_backtests`/`_process_and_save_results` for orchestration, but the monstrous function remained as unused code that tests were still mocking.
- **Fix**: Deleted the entire `clear_and_recalculate_strategies` function, removed it from `__all__` exports, cleaned up unnecessary imports (`data`, `backtester`, `get_active_strategy_combinations`), and updated tests to mock the actual functions being called by the CLI.
- **Lesson**: When CLI commands are refactored to use proper modular design, ensure dead code is immediately deleted. The persistence layer should ONLY handle database operations, not orchestrate business logic. Tests should mock actual dependencies, not dead code. Following Kailash Nadh's philosophy: each module should have a single, focused responsibility.

## CLI DRY Violation: Massive Code Duplication in clear-and-recalculate Command (2025-07-25)
- **Issue**: The `clear-and-recalculate` command contained a complete, duplicated copy (~50 LOC) of the backtesting and reporting pipeline from the `run` command, violating DRY principles. Tests were also failing because they mocked the old `clear_and_recalculate_strategies` function that was no longer being called in the refactored implementation.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The command was implemented as a monolithic function instead of reusing the modular helper functions (`_run_backtests`, `_process_and_save_results`) that were already extracted from the `run` command. This created maintenance burden and potential for behavioral drift between the two commands.
- **Fix**: Gutted the duplicated logic and replaced it with calls to the same helper functions used by the `run` command. Updated tests to verify actual behavior instead of mocking implementation details, testing the real database state rather than expected mock return values.
- **Lesson**: When adding new commands that share functionality with existing ones, always extract and reuse helper functions rather than duplicating code. Tests should verify behavior, not implementation details - avoid mocking internal functions when possible, and test actual outcomes instead.

## Test Mock Mismatch: Function Name Inconsistency (2025-07-25)
- **Issue**: Test failure `AttributeError: module 'kiss_signal.reporter' does not have the attribute 'analyze_rule_performance'` in `test_analyze_rules_exception_handling`. The test was trying to mock a function that doesn't exist.
- **Structural Root Cause**: Naming inconsistency between test expectations and actual implementation. The test expected `analyze-rules` command with `analyze_rule_performance` function, but the actual implementation has `analyze-strategies` command with `analyze_strategy_performance`/`analyze_strategy_performance_aggregated` functions. This represents a classic case of test-implementation drift where the test was never updated to match the final naming conventions.
- **Fix**: Updated the test to mock the correct function (`analyze_strategy_performance_aggregated`) and use the correct command name (`analyze-strategies`).
- **Lesson**: Tests must mirror the actual API, not outdated design assumptions. When functions are renamed during development, all tests mocking those functions must be updated simultaneously. Mock targets should always be verified to exist before writing tests.

## Test Suite Desynchronization: Incomplete CLI Refactoring (2025-07-25)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures (`AttributeError`, `AssertionError`) were traced to a structural flaw where the test suite was not updated after a major CLI simplification (Story 22). The refactoring removed the `analyze-rules` command and inverted the default behavior of `analyze-strategies` to show an aggregated view instead of a per-stock view.
- **Structural Root Cause**: API contract desynchronization. The test suite continued to test the old, more complex CLI API. This resulted in "zombie tests" for deleted code (`analyze-rules`) and assertion failures in tests that incorrectly assumed the default output of `analyze-strategies` was still per-stock.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Deletion**: Deleted the obsolete test for the removed `analyze-rules` command.
    2.  **Mock Correction**: Updated tests for the default `analyze-strategies` behavior to mock the correct underlying function (`..._aggregated`).
    3.  **Invocation Correction**: Added the `--per-stock` flag to tests that were specifically designed to validate the per-stock output format, aligning them with the new, non-default invocation.
- **Lesson**: A refactoring is not complete until all consumers, including the test suite, are updated. Tests must accurately reflect the public API and its default behaviors. When a command's default output changes, tests that rely on the old default must be explicitly updated to invoke the new, non-default mode to remain valid.

## Incomplete Refactoring: Test Suite Desynchronization (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: A large number of test failures (`AttributeError`) were traced to a structural flaw where the test suite was calling private helper functions in `data.py` that no longer existed. The functions `_load_symbol_cache` and `_save_symbol_cache` had been refactored and renamed to `_load_cache` and `_save_cache` to unify caching logic, but the corresponding calls throughout the test suite were not updated.
- **Structural Root Cause**: API contract desynchronization due to an incomplete refactoring. The internal API of the `data.py` module changed, but its primary consumers in the test suite were not updated, rendering a significant portion of the test harness invalid and unable to catch real regressions.
- **Fix**: Systematically updated all test files (`test_data_*.py`, `test_timestamp_comparison_fix.py`) to call the new, renamed cache functions (`_load_cache`, `_save_cache`). Additionally, corrected mock call signatures and brittle assertions in other tests to bring the entire test suite back in sync with the application's current API.
- **Lesson**: When refactoring a module's API (public or private), the change is not complete until all consumersâ€”including the test suiteâ€”are updated. Use IDE tools for global search-and-replace on function names during refactoring. Tests are first-class consumers of your code's API and must be maintained with the same rigor as production code to prevent architectural drift and ensure the test suite remains a reliable safety net.

## Zombie Parameter Pandemic: Incomplete API Refactoring (2025-07-21)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures (`TypeError` and `AttributeError`) traced to a structural flaw where calling code referenced parameters and attributes that no longer exist. The core issue was an incomplete refactoring where caching refresh parameters (`cache_refresh_days`, `refresh_days`) were removed from function signatures and config models, but not from all calling sites.
- **Structural Root Cause**: API contract desynchronization across module boundaries. The `reporter.py` module attempted to access `config.cache_refresh_days` (non-existent) and pass `refresh_days` to `get_price_data()` (non-existent parameter). Similarly, tests called `refresh_market_data()` with `refresh_days` parameter that the function doesn't accept. This created a cascade of parameter mismatches.
- **Fix**: Systematically removed all references to zombie parameters throughout the codebase:
  1. Removed `refresh_days=config.cache_refresh_days` call in `reporter.py`
  2. Fixed all test calls to `refresh_market_data()` to remove non-existent `refresh_days` parameter
  3. Corrected test calls to use named parameters instead of error-prone positional arguments
- **Lesson**: When refactoring function signatures or removing config options, systematically search and update ALL calling sites using grep/IDE search. Zombie parameters create subtle API contract violations that lead to runtime failures. Always use named parameters in tests to make parameter mismatches obvious. The absence of compile-time checking in Python makes this discipline critical.

## Logic Duplication and Zombie Parameters in Caching Layer (2025-07-30)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures (`TypeError`) were traced to a structural flaw in the data caching layer (`data.py`). The core issue was duplicated and inconsistent logic for checking cache freshness. The function `get_market_data` had a different, more confusing implementation for this check compared to `get_price_data`. This was compounded by a deprecated `refresh_days` parameter that was still present in multiple function signatures (a "zombie parameter") but was ignored by the implementation, leading to incorrect test setups that caused the failures.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Standardization (DRY)**: The caching logic was standardized by refactoring `get_market_data` to use the same clear pattern as `get_price_data`. The redundant `if not cache_file.exists()` check in `get_price_data` was also removed, as the helper function already performed it, creating a single, canonical implementation for cache validation.
    2.  **Zombie Parameter Removal**: The deprecated `refresh_days` parameter was completely removed from the codebaseâ€”from the `Config` model and YAML files down to the private helper function `_needs_refresh`.
    3.  **Test Correction**: The associated broken tests were corrected to match the simplified, correct function signature.
- **Lesson**: Logic duplication, even for simple tasks like cache checking, is a structural risk that leads to code drift and maintenance issues. Always refactor to a single source of truth (DRY). Deprecated parameters should be fully removed from all layers of the application (config, function signatures, calls) to prevent confusion and future bugs.

## Logic Duplication and Flawed Initialization (2025-07-29)
- **Issue**: Two test failures were traced to two distinct structural flaws:
    1.  **Flawed Initialization**: The `backtester`'s context filter combination logic was initialized with `None`, causing a `TypeError` when the first filter was applied. This error was caught by a broad `except` block, which returned an all-`False` series, causing an assertion failure.
    2.  **Logic Duplication**: The `data` module contained duplicated logic for checking cache freshnessâ€”one generic function and one inline implementation for market data. A test for market data caching was patching the generic function, which was never called, while the un-mocked inline logic failed, causing the test to fail.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Correct Initialization**: The context filter accumulator in `backtester.py` was correctly initialized to a `pd.Series` of all `True` values, the neutral element for a logical AND operation.
    2.  **Code De-duplication**: The generic `_needs_refresh` function in `data.py` was refactored to be more flexible, and the duplicated inline logic was removed and replaced with a call to the single, canonical function.
- **Lesson**:
    -   Iterative combination logic (like applying filters) must be initialized with the correct neutral element for the operation (e.g., `True` for AND, `False` for OR).
    -   Duplicated logic is a structural flaw that increases maintenance burden and creates subtle bugs, especially when tests target one implementation but the other is executed. Always refactor to a single source of truth (DRY principle).

## Data Schema Consistency: Cache Save/Load Contract Violation (2025-07-20)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were caused by inconsistent data format assumptions between cache save and load operations, along with premature column access before validation.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The cache system had inconsistent data format contracts between `_save_market_cache()` and `_load_market_cache()` functions. Save operations used `reset_index()` creating unpredictable column names ('index' vs 'date'), while load operations expected specific formats. Additionally, the `market_above_sma()` function accessed columns for debugging before validating their existence, violating defensive programming principles.
- **Symptoms**: 7 test failures including:
  - Shape mismatches (5,4) vs (5,5) indicating column loss
  - KeyError: 'close' when accessing columns before validation
  - Column order corruption and missing 'open' columns
  - "cannot reindex on an axis with duplicate labels" from corrupted datetime indices
- **Fix**: 
  1. **Consistent Cache Format**: Modified save/load functions to maintain consistent schema - save preserves datetime index as 'date' column, load handles both 'date' and 'index' columns with duplicate removal
  2. **Validation Before Access**: Moved `_validate_ohlcv_columns()` call before any column access in `market_above_sma()`
  3. **Enhanced Data Handling**: Added support for both 'date' and 'index' column patterns in market data processing
- **Lesson**: Data serialization boundaries must maintain strict format contracts. Cache save/load operations should be symmetric and handle edge cases like unnamed indices. Always validate data schema before accessing columns, especially in functions that accept data from multiple sources (cache, API, files).

## API Contract Desynchronization: Incomplete Refactoring (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: Multiple tests for the `clear-and-recalculate` command failed with `AttributeError`, indicating a mocked function (`persistence.clear_and_recalculate_strategies`) did not exist. The application was also broken at runtime.
- **Structural Root Cause**: An incomplete refactoring had removed a key orchestrator function from the `persistence.py` module, but its primary consumer (`cli.py`) and the test suite were not updated. This broke the API contract between the two modules, leaving the system in a non-functional state.
- **Fix**: The missing `clear_and_recalculate_strategies` function was restored in `persistence.py` to fulfill the API contract expected by the CLI and the test suite. This restored the broken control flow and fixed both the application and the tests.
- **Lesson**: Refactoring is not complete until all consumers of the refactored codeâ€”including the application's own modules and its test suiteâ€”are updated to match the new API contract. A missing public function that breaks a module boundary is a critical structural failure that must be addressed by either restoring the component or updating all consumers to use the new design.

## SQLite Data Type Integrity: String Division Errors from Numeric Operations (2025-07-20)
- **Issue**: Test failures in `test_clear_and_recalculate_basic_flow` and related tests with error "unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'" during symbol processing.
- **Structural Root Cause**: Data type integrity failure across module boundaries between persistence layer (`persistence.py`) and business logic (`backtester.py`). SQLite stores REAL numbers but Python's `sqlite3` module can return them as strings under certain conditions. The codebase assumed pandas `.sum()` operations on boolean Series would always return integers, but when underlying data originated from SQLite as strings, these operations returned string values that failed in division operations.
- **Fix**: Added explicit `int()` conversion to `.sum()` results before arithmetic operations in `backtester.py` lines 453 and 464: `filter_count = int(aligned_filter.sum())` and `combined_count = int(combined_signals.sum())`.
- **Lesson**: SQLite data type integrity must be enforced at persistence boundaries. Numeric operations should always include explicit type conversion when data originates from SQLite. Assume that pandas operations on SQLite-derived data may return strings and guard accordingly.

## Data Serialization Integrity: Asymmetric Save/Load Operations (2025-07-19)
- **Issue**: Test failure in `test_market_cache_save_load_cycle` where loaded DataFrame had shape (5,4) instead of original (5,5), indicating loss of DateTime index during cache save/load cycle.
- **Structural Root Cause**: Asymmetric serialization logic between `_save_market_cache()` and `_load_market_cache()` functions. Save operation used `index=False` discarding the DateTime index, while load operation expected either a 'date' column or fallback index parsing, creating a data integrity violation across module boundaries.
- **Fix**: Modified `_save_market_cache()` to preserve DateTime index as 'date' column using `reset_index()`, ensuring symmetric save/load operations that maintain DataFrame structural contracts.
- **Lesson**: Paired serialization/deserialization operations must have consistent data format assumptions. When designing cache or persistence layers, the save and load operations must preserve complete data structure integrity, especially for time-series data where the index is semantically important.

## CLI Argument Structure: Typer Global Option Positioning (2025-07-19)
- **Issue**: Test failure in `test_run_command_backtest_generic_exception_verbose` where CLI test expected exit code 1 but received exit code 2.
- **Structural Root Cause**: Mismatch between Typer's CLI argument parsing rules and test invocation. The test placed global option `--verbose` after the command name (`run --verbose`) instead of before (`--verbose run`), violating Typer's callback-based architecture where global options defined in `@app.callback()` must precede command names.
- **Fix**: Moved `--verbose` to proper position before command name in test invocation, aligning with Typer's global option parsing requirements.
- **Lesson**: CLI framework conventions must be strictly followed in tests. Typer's global options (defined in callbacks) have different positioning rules than command-specific options. Test invocations must mirror valid user command patterns exactly.

## Test Harness Integrity: Test Suite Pollution and Error Masking (2025-07-29)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were caused by structural flaws in the test suite itself.
    1.  **Test Suite Pollution**: Script files (`test_context_filter*.py`) that were not valid `pytest` tests were being discovered and executed, causing spurious failures and noise.
    2.  **Error Masking**: A core data function (`_load_market_cache`) used a broad `except Exception:` clause that caught a specific `ValueError` ("Empty cache file") and re-wrapped it in a generic one ("Corrupted market cache file"), breaking tests that asserted on the specific error message.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Deletion**: The invalid script files were deleted from the test directory, cleaning the test suite.
    2.  **Refactoring**: The error handling in `_load_market_cache` was refactored to separate I/O/parsing error handling from business logic validation, allowing specific exceptions to propagate correctly.
- **Lesson**: The test harness is a critical part of the application's structure.
    -   The test suite must be kept clean of non-test scripts to ensure reliable results.
    -   Error handling logic should be precise, avoiding broad `except` clauses that mask specific, meaningful exceptions that tests or callers might need to act upon.


## Error Handling Hierarchy: Inconsistent Exception Flow (2025-07-18)
- **Issue**: The `clear_and_recalculate_strategies()` function had inconsistent error handling where data-related exceptions were being swallowed by a catch-all handler instead of propagating to the CLI level as intended.
- **Structural Flaw**: Two-tier exception handling with overlapping responsibilities - specific exceptions (`ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `ConnectionError`) had conditional re-raising logic, but generic `Exception` handler was catching data errors before the string-based detection could work.
- **Fix**: Moved data-related error detection (string matching for "fetch"/"data") to the general exception handler to ensure consistent propagation regardless of exception type.
- **Lesson**: Error handling hierarchy must be designed with clear, non-overlapping responsibilities. String-based error classification should be applied consistently across all exception types when determining whether to propagate vs. handle gracefully.

## Test Harness Integrity: Flawed Invocation and Non-Resilient Setup (2025-07-25)
    1.  **Flawed CLI Invocation (`test_run_command_backtest_generic_exception_verbose`):** A test invoked the Typer CLI with an incorrect argument order (a global option like `--verbose` placed after the `run` command), causing a framework `UsageError` (exit code 2) instead of testing the application's error handling (exit code 1).
    2.  **Non-Resilient Test Setup (`test_run_command_help`):** A help-text test for a subcommand (`run --help`) failed because it was not self-contained. It relied on filesystem state (e.g., `config.yaml`), causing the main CLI callback to fail on config loading before the help text could be displayed.
    2.  Simplified the brittle help test to target the main application's help text (`--help`), which is more robust and does not depend on a fully configured test environment.
    -   Tests should be self-contained and not rely on implicit filesystem state, especially for meta-commands like `--help`.
    1.  Corrected the CLI test invocation to place global options before the command, aligning the test with actual user behavior.
    2.  Simplified the brittle help test to target the main application's help text (`--help`), which is more robust and does not depend on a fully configured test environment.
- **Lesson**: A project's test harness is part of its core structure and must be as robust as the application code.
    -   CLI tests must precisely mirror valid user invocation patterns.
    -   Tests should be self-contained and not rely on implicit filesystem state, especially for meta-commands like `--help`.

## Test Harness Integrity: Brittle Assertions and Flawed I/O Capture (2025-07-23)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were traced back to structural flaws in the test harness, not the application logic.
    1.  **Brittle Assertion (`test_generate_signals_missing_parameters`):** A test was asserting on a generic error message string. When the application was improved to raise a more specific error, the test broke, despite the application's behavior being correct.
    2.  **Flawed I/O Capture (`test_run_command_log_save_failure`):** A test for a logging side-effect asserted on `stderr`, but the application's `RichHandler` directs `logger.error` output to `stdout`. The test was "deaf" to the correct output and failed by asserting on an empty stream.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Corrected Assertion:** The brittle test was updated to assert on the new, more specific error message, making it more robust.
    2.  **Corrected I/O Check:** The logging test was fixed to check `result.stdout` instead of `result.stderr`, aligning the test with the application's actual, observable behavior.
- **Lesson**: The test harness is a critical part of the application's structure.
    -   Tests should be robust against minor implementation changes (like improving an error message). Avoid asserting on exact strings where possible, or update tests when application code is improved.
    -   Tests must correctly model the application's I/O and logging behavior. When a custom logging handler like `RichHandler` is used, standard fixtures like `caplog` may not work as expected, and asserting on the final console output (`stdout`/`stderr`) is often a more reliable pattern.

## Test Harness Integrity: Non-Deterministic Tests (2025-07-24)
- **Issue**: A performance test (`test_get_summary`) relied on the non-deterministic timing of `time.sleep()`, making it flaky and unreliable. The test would pass or fail based on system load.
- **Fix**: Replaced the `time.sleep()`-based test with a deterministic one using `unittest.mock.patch` on `time.time()` to control the flow of time precisely. By providing a `side_effect` list of timestamps, the test's duration calculations became independent of actual wall-clock time.
- **Lesson**: Tests must be deterministic. Avoid relying on system-dependent behaviors like `time.sleep()` for assertions. Use mocking to control the environment and remove flakiness.

## AI Coding Pitfalls (Most Common)

### NEVER Reference Non-Existent Methods/Attributes
- `dm.cache_dir`, `dm._validate_data_quality()`, `dm._save_symbol_cache()`
- **Fix**: DELETE broken tests immediately (H-3: prefer deletion)
- **Prevention**: Always verify method signatures exist before writing tests

### Import Anti-Patterns  
- Unused imports: `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.timedelta` 
- Undefined modules: `data` without proper import path
- **Fix**: Remove all unused/incorrect imports
- **Prevention**: Only import what's actually used

### Third-Party Library Pitfalls
- **VectorBT**: NEVER use `size_type='shares'` (invalid enum), use documented defaults
- **Typer**: Use `str` parameters for file paths, convert to `Path` inside functions
- **Rich**: Avoid `console.print()`, `console.save_text()` in `finally` blocks (OS errors)
- **Prevention**: Validate parameters against library documentation

## Test/Component Desynchronization (Major Pattern)

### Root Cause: Tests not updated when components are refactored
- Missing method signatures: `_calculate_win_percentage()` 
- Wrong data types: `str` vs `pathlib.Path`
- Obsolete keywords: `min_trades` vs `min_trades_threshold`
- Missing CLI arguments: `--config`, `--rules` requirements

### Prevention Checklist
- [ ] Update all tests when changing component APIs
- [ ] Run mypy on test files before commit
- [ ] Verify CLI tests use correct argument order (`--verbose` before `run`)
- [ ] Remove tests for deleted functionality immediately
## Data Contract Violations (Critical Pattern)

### Pydantic Model vs Dict Contract Mismatches
- **Root Cause**: Components expecting dicts but receiving Pydantic models (or vice versa)
- **Example**: Backtester expected `rules_config['baseline']` but received `RulesConfig.baseline`
- **Symptom**: `TypeError: 'RulesConfig' object is not subscriptable`
- **Fix**: Update component to accept Pydantic models and use attribute access
- **Prevention**: Keep type hints current; use `RulesConfig` not `dict` in signatures

### Pydantic Attribute Access Anti-Pattern
- **Issue**: Using `.get()` method on Pydantic objects (RuleDef, etc.)
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'RuleDef' object has no attribute 'get'`
- **Fix**: Use direct attribute access (`rule.name`, `rule.type`, `rule.params`)
- **Prevention**: Remember Pydantic models are NOT dicts - use attributes, not dict methods

### Test Data Temporal Coverage
- **Issue**: Test data ending before freeze/analysis dates
- **Example**: Data to 2023-12-31 but freeze date 2024-06-01 = no backtest data
- **Fix**: Ensure test data covers analysis period + buffer
- **Prevention**: Generate test data to at least 6 months after latest analysis date

### Cache/Data Loading Boundaries
- **Issue**: DataFrames need `date` column for caching, `DatetimeIndex` after loading
- **VectorBT Requirements**: DatetimeIndex must have frequency set (use `pd.infer_freq()` or `asfreq('D')`)
- **Column Names**: Must be lowercase (`close` not `Close`) - enforce in `_load_symbol_cache`
- **Prevention**: Data loaders must guarantee contracts regardless of source (API/cache/file)

### Config Object Mismatches
- **Type vs Name**: Use `rule.get('name', rule['type'])` for display, `type` for execution
- **API Drift**: `rules_config` dict vs `rule_stack` list - keep signatures synchronized
- **Prevention**: Components should accept raw config and parse internally

## CLI Framework Issues (Recurring)

### Typer Path Handling
- **Issue**: `Path` type hints trigger `exists=True` validation before app logic
- **Fix**: Use `str` parameters, convert to `Path` inside functions
- **Prevention**: Avoid framework "magic" for critical validation paths

### Test Invocation Syntax
- **Issue**: Global options (`--verbose`) must come BEFORE command (`run`)
- **Wrong**: `run --verbose --config x`
- **Correct**: `--verbose run --config x`
- **Prevention**: Test CLI syntax exactly as users would type it

### Resilient Parsing
- **Issue**: Main callbacks executing during `--help` generation
- **Fix**: Use `if ctx.resilient_parsing: return` at callback start
- **Prevention**: Keep main callbacks lightweight for meta-commands

## State Management Anti-Patterns

### Reporter State Consistency
- **Issue**: Reading state AFTER writing new state (double-counting)
- **Fix**: Read existing state BEFORE making changes, report separately
- **Prevention**: Clear separation of "read state" vs "write state" phases

### Resource Leaks
- **Issue**: File handles left open during test cleanup (`logging.handlers`)
- **Fix**: Explicit `handler.close()` before removing handlers
- **Prevention**: Use context managers or explicit cleanup in `finally` blocks

## Performance & I/O Robustness

### Environment-Sensitive Operations
- **Avoid**: `rich.console` operations in `finally` blocks (triggers OS errors)
- **Use**: `console.export_text()` + `Path.write_text()` for log saving
- **Prevention**: Standard Python I/O in critical teardown paths

### VectorBT Integration
- **Issue**: Manual loops instead of vectorized operations
- **Correct**: `entry_signals.vbt.fshift(hold_period)` for time-based exits
- **Prevention**: Use library-idiomatic patterns, avoid manual implementations

## Historical Issues Archive

### CLI Testing Antipatterns (2025-06-15)
- **Issue**: `UsageError` (exit code 2) vs expected application errors
- **Causes**: Manual `os.chdir()`, implicit CWD dependencies, wrong `typer` patterns
- **Fix**: Use `runner.isolated_filesystem()`, `typer.Typer()` app, explicit paths

### Config Synchronization (2025-06-16)  
- **Issue**: Pydantic models missing consumer-required fields (`cache_dir`, `hold_period`)
- **Fix**: Keep config as strict shared interface, patch source libraries directly
- **Prevention**: Single canonical config, complete test environments

### Component API Desynchronization (2025-06-23 to 2025-06-29)
- **Pattern**: Refactoring breaks component contracts, tests not updated
- **Examples**: Wrong method signatures, obsolete keywords, missing CLI args
- **Fix**: Update internal logic, tests, and consumers in lockstep
- **Prevention**: Treat tests as first-class API consumers

### Data Contract Violations (2025-06-24 to 2025-06-27)
- **Pattern**: Cache requires `date` column, loader expects `DatetimeIndex` 
- **VectorBT**: Requires frequency on DatetimeIndex (`pd.infer_freq()`)
- **Fix**: Enforce contracts at data boundary regardless of source
- **Prevention**: Data loaders guarantee schema consistency

### Resource Management (2025-06-25 to 2025-06-26)
- **Issue**: Unclosed file handles, brittle I/O tests
- **Fix**: `handler.close()` before removing, avoid environment-dependent tests
- **Prevention**: Robust cleanup, test success paths only

### State Management (2025-06-28 to 2025-07-21)
- **Pattern**: Incorrect sequence of read/write operations
- **Examples**: Display names vs execution types, pre/post-run state confusion
- **Fix**: Read existing state before modifications, clear data flow separation
- **Prevention**: Single responsibility for state transitions

## Signal Combination Logic Flaw (Structural Issue)

### Root Cause: Invalid signal initialization in backtester
- **Issue**: Starting with `pd.Series(True, index=price_data.index)` and ANDing with rule signals
- **Problem**: Rule signals are sparse (few True values), ANDing with all-True series produces zero signals
- **Symptom**: All strategies generate 0 trades regardless of data quality or rule configurations
- **Fix**: Start with first rule's signals, then AND subsequent rules: `entry_signals = rule_signals.copy()` 
- **Lesson**: Signal combination requires understanding signal density - don't start with universal True state

## Overly Restrictive Signal Generation (2025-07-20)
- **Issue**: Backtesting on a large universe of stocks (92+) resulted in very few (e.g., 2) open positions, suggesting an issue with signal generation logic.
- **Structural Root Cause**: The low signal count is primarily a feature of the high-conviction strategy design, which combines multiple strict rules (e.g., `engulfing_pattern` AND `volume_spike`) and a `min_trades_threshold` that filters out strategies that do not fire often. This is expected behavior. However, investigation revealed a subtle but critical bug in the signal combination logic in `reporter.py`'s `_find_signals_in_window`. The original implementation could incorrectly filter out all signals when combining multiple sparse rule outputs, leading to an artificially low number of trades and a discrepancy with the backtester's logic.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Very few strategies pass the `min_trades_threshold`.
  - Daily reports show few or no new positions, even with a large stock universe.
- **Fix**: The signal combination logic in `reporter.py`'s `_find_signals_in_window` was corrected to properly initialize the combined signal series from the first rule's output before AND-ing it with subsequent rules. This ensures that the combination logic is sound and matches the backtester's approach.
- **Lesson**: When combining sparse boolean signals, the initialization of the combined series is critical. Starting with the first rule's signals and then iteratively applying logical ANDs is the correct approach. Duplicated logic (like signal combination) between backtesting and reporting modules must be kept perfectly synchronized to avoid discrepancies.

## Data Contract Mismatches (Pydantic vs Dict) (2025-07-21)
- **Issue**: Modules had inconsistent expectations for data structures. The `backtester` produces results containing Pydantic `RuleDef` objects, but consumers like the `persistence` layer serialize them to dictionaries (for JSON). Test mocks were also returning raw dictionaries instead of Pydantic objects. This led to `AttributeError` when functions expected an object but received a dictionary (e.g., `dict.key` vs `dict['key']`).
- **Fix**: Enforced the data contract at module boundaries.
    1.  Updated all test mocks to return Pydantic model instances (`RuleDef`, `RulesConfig`) where the real code would, ensuring tests accurately reflect the application's data flow.
    2.  Updated tests that directly called functions to instantiate the correct Pydantic models as inputs, rather than passing raw dictionaries.
    3.  Made consumer functions (like the CLI's display helper) more robust by using `getattr(obj, 'attr', default)` to handle both object and dictionary-like structures where appropriate, although fixing the source (the tests) was the primary solution.
- **Lesson**: When passing data objects between modules, especially across serialization boundaries (like persistence or test mocks), ensure the data types are consistent. Test mocks must return data with the same type and structure as the real implementation to be effective. Enforce Pydantic model contracts in function signatures and test inputs.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: asfreq() NaN Value Bug (2025-06-30)
**STRICT RULE: NEVER IGNORE THIS PATTERN**

- **Issue**: `pandas.asfreq('D')` creates NaN values for weekends/holidays, breaking all SMA/EMA calculations
- **Symptom**: All rolling calculations return NaN â†’ 0 signals generated â†’ 0 trades â†’ strategy failure
- **Root Cause**: `asfreq()` fills missing calendar days with NaN; rolling windows can't handle NaN data
- **Critical Fix Pattern**: ALWAYS forward-fill after `asfreq()`:
  ```python
  # Handle NaN values created by asfreq - forward fill to preserve trading data
  if price_data.isnull().any().any():
      price_data = price_data.ffill()
      logger.debug(f"Forward-filled NaN values after frequency adjustment for {symbol}")
  ```
- **Evidence**: Application went from 0 signals to 20+ signals per symbol after fix
- **Prevention**: ANY time `asfreq()` is used, immediately check for and handle NaN values
- **Memory Aid**: asfreq = "as frequency" = calendar gaps = NaN poison = ALWAYS ffill()

## Rule Implementation Drift: Strict vs. Standard Definitions (2025-07-01)
- **Issue**: The `engulfing_pattern` rule failed to detect a valid pattern because its implementation used a strict less-than (`<`) comparison for the low engulfment (`current_open < prev_close`) instead of the standard less-than-or-equal-to (`<=`). This caused the rule to miss edge-case signals where the open of the current candle was exactly at the close of the previous one.
- **Symptom**: Tests for `engulfing_pattern` failed on valid edge-case data. Backtests would silently miss valid trading signals, leading to suboptimal strategy discovery.
- **Fix**: The comparison was changed from `<` to `<=` to align with the standard financial definition of the pattern.
- **Lesson**: Financial rule implementations must be rigorously validated against their standard definitions, including edge cases. A seemingly minor logical error (like `<` vs. `<=`) can represent a significant "implementation drift" from the intended strategy, creating a structural flaw in the rule library. Future rule development should include a "definitional review" step to ensure the code accurately reflects the financial concept it represents.

## Test Harness Integrity: CLI and Fixture Robustness (2025-07-18)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were traced back to structural flaws in the test harness, not the application logic itself.
    1.  **CLI Invocation Errors**: Tests were calling the Typer CLI with incorrect argument order (e.g., `run --verbose` instead of `--verbose run`), leading to `UsageError` (exit code 2) instead of the expected application error (exit code 1).
    2.  **Incomplete Fixtures**: A pytest fixture for the `Config` object was providing a path to a `universe.csv` file but not creating the file itself. This caused Pydantic's `field_validator`, which checks for file existence, to fail during test setup.
- **Fix**:
    1.  Corrected the argument order in `runner.invoke` calls within `test_cli_advanced.py` to place global options before the command.
    2.  Modified the fixture in `test_reporter_position_management.py` to create the dummy `universe.csv` file, ensuring the `Config` object is instantiated in a valid state.
- **Lesson**: A project's test harness is part of its core structure. Tests must be robust and reflect real-world usage (correct CLI syntax). Fixtures must create a complete and valid state for the components they provide, especially when those components have built-in validation logic. An incomplete fixture is a bug in the test suite.

## Test Suite Desynchronization and API Drift (2025-07-18)
- **Issue**: A large number of test failures in the `reporter` module were caused by a structural desynchronization between the test suite and the application code. This included:
    1.  **API Contract Drift**: Function signatures (e.g., `_identify_new_signals`) were modified in the implementation without updating test calls, leading to `TypeError`.
    2.  **Incomplete Refactoring**: Tests for a refactored private helper (`_check_for_signal`) were left behind, creating "zombie tests" that failed with `AttributeError`.
    3.  **Brittle Tests**: Some tests used incorrect assertion patterns for numpy booleans (`is True`) or patched non-existent attributes, making them fragile.
- **Fix**: A comprehensive cleanup was performed:
    1.  Corrected the function signatures in `reporter.py` to match their required data contracts.
    2.  Deleted obsolete test files and classes (`test_reporter_signal_checking.py`, `TestCheckForSignal`) that targeted non-existent code.
    3.  Refactored brittle tests to use robust assertion patterns and valid mocks.
- **Lesson**: The test suite must be treated as a first-class consumer of the application's API. Any refactoring or signature change is incomplete until the corresponding tests are updated or removed. Maintaining test-code synchronization is critical to prevent architectural drift and ensure the test suite remains a reliable safety net.

## Test Suite Integrity: Obsolete Tests and Flawed Invocations (2025-07-18)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were caused by a desynchronization between the test suite and the application's state.
    1.  **Obsolete Tests**: Tests in `test_reporter_position_management.py` targeted private helper functions (`_manage_open_positions`) that had been refactored away into a larger public method. These tests failed with `AttributeError` and no longer reflected the public API.
    2.  **Flawed CLI Invocation**: A test in `test_cli_advanced.py` invoked the Typer CLI with an incorrect argument order (global options after the command), causing a `UsageError` (exit code 2) instead of the expected application error (exit code 1).
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Deletion of Obsolete Tests**: The obsolete test file (`test_reporter_position_management.py`) was deleted entirely. The consolidated logic is sufficiently covered by higher-level integration tests that validate the public API, not brittle implementation details.
    2.  **Correction of Flawed Tests**: The CLI test invocation was corrected to place global options before the command, aligning the test with actual user behavior.
- **Lesson**: The test suite is a core part of the application's structure and must be maintained with the same discipline as production code. Refactoring is incomplete until corresponding tests are updated or **deleted**. Zombie tests for non-existent private methods create noise and erode trust in the test suite. CLI tests must precisely mirror valid user invocation patterns to be reliable.

## Structural Refactoring: Reporter and Position Management (2025-07-04)
- **Issue**: The `reporter` module was responsible for both generating reports and managing the state of open positions (calculating metrics, determining whether to hold or sell). This violated the Single Responsibility Principle and made the reporter difficult to test and maintain. Test failures in `test_reporter_position_management.py` revealed this structural issue, with tests failing because the position management functions had been moved without updating the tests.
- **Fix**:
    1.  A new `position_manager.py` module was created to exclusively handle the business logic of managing open positions.
    2.  The `_manage_open_positions` and `_calculate_open_position_metrics` functions were moved from `reporter.py` to `position_manager.py`.
    3.  The `reporter.py` module was updated to import and use the `position_manager` module, delegating all position management tasks.
    4.  The corresponding test file, `test_reporter_position_management.py`, was updated to import and test the `position_manager` module directly.
- **Lesson**: Code should be organized by responsibility. Separating concerns into distinct modules (e.g., reporting vs. position management) improves modularity, testability, and maintainability. When tests for a specific piece of functionality break, it often signals a deeper structural issue that should be addressed through refactoring rather than a simple patch.

## Test Harness Integrity: Flawed Invocations and Resource Leaks (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were traced back to structural flaws in the test harness, not the application logic itself.
    1.  **Flawed CLI Invocation**: A test in `test_cli_advanced.py` invoked the Typer CLI with an incorrect argument order (global options after the command), causing a framework `UsageError` (exit code 2) instead of testing the application's error handling (exit code 1).
    2.  **Non-Resilient Test Setup**: A help-text test in `test_cli_basic.py` failed because it was not self-contained and relied on filesystem state, causing the non-resilient part of the CLI callback to fail on config loading.
    3.  **Resource Leaks in Fixtures**: The `test_integration_cli.py` fixture used manual `tempfile` and `shutil` calls, which led to a `PermissionError` on Windows during teardown because a database file handle was not released in time.
- **Fix**:
    1.  Corrected the CLI test invocation in `test_cli_advanced.py` to place global options before the command.
    2.  Simplified the help test in `test_cli_basic.py` to test the main application's help text, which is more robust and does not depend on the filesystem.
    3.  Replaced the brittle `tempfile`-based fixture in `test_integration_cli.py` with pytest's standard `tmp_path` fixture, which guarantees proper resource management and cleanup.
- **Lesson**: A project's test harness is part of its core structure and must be as robust as the application code.
    -   CLI tests must precisely mirror valid user invocation patterns.
    -   Tests should be self-contained and not rely on implicit filesystem state.
    -   Use framework-provided fixtures (like `tmp_path`) for resource management over manual implementations to avoid platform-specific issues like file locking.

## Test Harness Integrity: Configuration and Fixture Desynchronization (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: A major refactoring of the `clear-and-recalculate` feature occurred, changing the return type of `persistence.clear_and_recalculate_strategies` from a `List` of new strategies to a `Dict` containing an operational summary. The test suite was not updated in parallel.
- **Symptoms**:
    1.  **API Contract Drift**: Tests in `test_persistence.py` failed with `AssertionError` because they were asserting on the old `List` contract (e.g., `isinstance(result, list)`) instead of the new `Dict` contract.
    2.  **Flawed Mocks**: Tests for the `clear-and-recalculate` command in `test_cli_*.py` were mocking helper functions from the `run` command's workflow (`_run_backtests`, etc.) instead of the actual dependency (`persistence.clear_and_recalculate_strategies`). This made the tests completely detached from the implementation, causing them to fail unexpectedly.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Corrected Assertions**: The persistence tests were updated to assert against the new `Dict` contract (e.g., `assert isinstance(result, dict)`, `assert result['new_strategies'] == 1`).
    2.  **Corrected Mocks**: The CLI tests were rewritten to mock the correct dependency (`persistence.clear_and_recalculate_strategies`) and assert on the observable CLI output, realigning the tests with the actual implementation.
    3.  **Improved Robustness**: The exception handling in the persistence layer was broadened to catch `Exception` instead of specific subtypes, making the data processing loop more resilient.
- **Lesson**: The test suite is a first-class consumer of the application's API. Any refactoring is incomplete until the corresponding tests are updated or deleted. Maintaining test-code synchronization is critical to prevent architectural drift and ensure the test suite remains a reliable safety net. Zombie tests for old implementations must be killed, and mocks must target the actual, direct dependencies of the code under test.

## Test Harness Integrity: Flawed Invocation and Data Structure Flaw (2025-07-23)
- **Issue**: A large number of test failures were caused by a structural desynchronization between the application's `Config` Pydantic model and the test fixtures that create `config.yaml` files or instantiate `Config` objects. The `Config` model was updated with new required fields (`reports_output_dir`, `edge_score_threshold`), but several test cases were not updated, leading to widespread `ValidationError` during test setup. Additionally, some CLI tests used incorrect argument ordering for Typer, and help-text tests were not resilient.
- **Fix**:
    1.  **Fixtures Updated**: All inline test configurations (`sample_config_dict` in `test_cli_advanced.py`) were updated to provide all required fields for the `Config` model, resolving the `ValidationError`.
    2.  **Correct CLI Invocation**: A CLI test was corrected to place global options (like `--verbose`) before the command, aligning with Typer's expected syntax and preventing a `UsageError`.
    3.  **Resilient Help Test**: The CLI help test was modified to test the main application's help text (`--help`) instead of a subcommand's, making it more robust and less dependent on a fully configured test environment.
- **Lesson**: The test harness is a critical part of the application's structure. Any change to a core data contract like a configuration model must be propagated to all test fixtures immediately. Fixtures must be self-contained and reflect valid user invocation patterns to be reliable. An incomplete fixture is a bug in the test suite.

## Test Harness Integrity: Configuration and Fixture Desynchronization (2025-07-22)
- **Issue**: A large number of test failures were caused by a structural desynchronization between the application's `Config` Pydantic model and the test fixtures that create `config.yaml` files or instantiate `Config` objects. The `Config` model was updated with new required fields (`reports_output_dir`, `edge_score_threshold`), but several test cases were not updated, leading to widespread `ValidationError` during test setup.

Fixtures must be self-contained and reflect valid user invocation patterns to be reliable. An incomplete fixture is a bug in the test suite.

## Test Harness Integrity: Flawed Invocation and Data Structure Flaw (2025-07-23)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were traced back to two distinct structural issues.
    1.  **Flawed Invocation (`test_run_command_log_save_failure`):** A test was asserting behavior (log saving on failure) on the `run` command, but the implementation for this behavior only existed in the `analyze-strategies` command. The test was testing a non-existent contract.
    2.  **Data Structure Initialization Flaw (`analyze_rule_performance`):** A `defaultdict` was incorrectly initialized to create a `set` (`{'metrics', 'symbols'}`) instead of a `dict` with list values (`{'metrics': [], 'symbols': []}`). This caused a `TypeError` downstream when the code attempted dictionary key access on a set.
- **Fix**:
    1.  The broken test was rewritten to target the correct command (`analyze-strategies`), aligning the test with the actual implementation.
    2.  The `defaultdict` initialization was corrected to produce the expected dictionary structure.
- **Lesson**:
    - Test harnesses are a critical part of the application's structure and must be kept in sync with the implementation. Tests should validate the actual, observable contracts of the code they target.
    - Data structures must be initialized correctly at their source. A subtle typo (like `{}` vs `[]` inside a `defaultdict` lambda) can create a structural flaw that propagates through the system and causes failures far from the origin point. Pay close attention to the structure of initialized objects.

## Test Harness Integrity: Brittle Mocks and Inconsistent Test Data (2025-07-24)
- **Issue**: Multiple test failures were traced back to structural flaws in the test harness, not the application logic.
    1.  **Inconsistent Test Data (`test_end_to_end_cli_workflow`):** An end-to-end test failed because its synthetic data generator produced backtest results that violated a hard assertion in the persistence layer (`total_trades >= 10`). The test environment was not creating data that respected the application's known business rule constraints, leading to a failure far downstream from the data generation step.
    2.  **Brittle Mocking (`test_get_summary`):** A performance test that mocked `time.time()` with a fixed-size iterator failed because it did not account for implicit calls to `time.time()` from the `logging` module, which was used within the function under test. This made the test fragile and dependent on the internal implementation of a third-party library.
- **Fix**:
    1.  The test data generator was updated to produce more realistic, cyclical data that generates a sufficient number of trades to satisfy the application's business rules, making the test self-consistent.
    2.  The `time.time` mock was made more robust by providing a sufficient number of return values to satisfy all explicit and implicit callers within the test's scope.
- **Lesson**: A project's test harness is part of its core structure and must be as robust as the application code.
    -   Test data fixtures must generate data that is consistent with the application's known business rules and data contracts to ensure end-to-end tests are valid.
    -   When mocking fundamental functions like `time.time()`, be aware of all potential consumers, including internal calls from libraries like `logging`. Provide a sufficiently large mock dataset or use more robust time-mocking libraries to avoid brittle, implementation-dependent tests.

## Test Configuration Isolation: Hardcoded Business Rules in Persistence Layer (2025-07-09)
- **Issue**: Integration tests failed due to a hardcoded business rule in the persistence layer that was inconsistent with configurable application logic.
    1.  **Hardcoded Threshold (`save_strategies_batch`):** The persistence layer had a hardcoded assertion `total_trades >= 10`, but the application's `min_trades_threshold` was configurable and could be set lower (e.g., 2).
    2.  **Configuration Validation Gap (`test_end_to_end_cli_workflow`):** Valid strategies generated by the backtester with `min_trades_threshold: 10` but fewer than 10 trades were rejected by the persistence layer, causing the `analyze-strategies` command to find "No historical strategies found to analyze."
- **Fix**:
    1.  The persistence layer's hardcoded threshold was changed to only validate that `total_trades > 0`, removing the business logic constraint that belonged in the backtester.
    2.  This allows the persistence layer to store any strategies that the backtester deems valid, maintaining consistency between configuration and persistence.
- **Lesson**: Business rules should exist in one place and be consistently applied across the system.
    -   Persistence layers should validate data integrity (non-null, correct types) but not duplicate business logic that exists elsewhere.
    -   Hardcoded thresholds in infrastructure code create configuration validation gaps where different parts of the system have different rules.
    -   When a test worked before and suddenly fails, look for changes in infrastructure code (like persistence) that may have introduced new constraints.

## Installed Package vs Development Source Import Conflict (2025-07-13)
- **Issue**: All tests failed during collection with `ImportError` for `RuleDef`, `RulesConfig`, `volume_spike`, and missing `performance` module. The error messages showed imports resolving to `D:\Code\stock_rule_based\venv\Lib\site-packages\kiss_signal\` instead of the current development source.
- **Root Cause**: An outdated installed version of `kiss_signal` package (dated June 28th) was present in site-packages and taking precedence over the current development source code in Python's import resolution.
- **Symptoms**: 
    - Tests couldn't import current classes/functions that exist in development source
    - Python was finding old installed package first due to import path priority
    - 5 test files completely failed to collect with ImportError
- **Fix**:
    1. **Removed conflicting package**: `pip uninstall kiss_signal -y` 
    2. **Fixed import path priority**: Added `src/` directory to Python path in `conftest.py`
    3. **Result**: 227 tests collected successfully, 225 passed (vs 0 collected before)
- **Lesson**: When developing a package locally, ensure no conflicting installed versions exist in the environment. Python's import resolution follows `sys.path` order, so installed packages can shadow development source code. Always check for installed versions when encountering mysterious import failures that claim classes/modules don't exist despite being visible in the source code.
    - **Prevention**: Use virtual environments properly and avoid installing the package being developed unless using editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
    - **Detection Pattern**: Import errors showing site-packages paths instead of local source paths
    - **Quick Check**: `pip list | grep package_name` and `dir venv\Lib\site-packages\` to identify conflicts
## Test Harness Integrity: Incomplete Mock Configuration in Transaction Tests (2025-07-16)
- **Issue**: Three persistence tests failed due to a structural flaw in mock configuration for database transaction rollback scenarios. The tests were setting up `side_effect` lists for `cursor.execute()` but not accounting for all SQL statements executed during error handling, specifically the `ROLLBACK` statement. This caused `StopIteration` exceptions when the mock tried to get the next effect from an exhausted iterator.
    1.  **Migration Test (`test_migrate_v2_error_handling`):** Mock returned a `MagicMock` object instead of a proper integer for database version comparison, causing `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'MagicMock' and 'int'`.
    2.  **Transaction Rollback Tests:** Both `test_close_positions_transaction_rollback` and `test_add_positions_transaction_rollback` failed with `StopIteration` because their mocks didn't include the `ROLLBACK` statement in the `side_effect` list.
- **Fix**: 
    1.  Updated the migration test mock to properly return an integer value for the database version check by configuring `mock_result.__getitem__.return_value = 1`.
    2.  Extended the `side_effect` lists in both transaction rollback tests to include `None` for the `ROLLBACK` statement, ensuring the mock can handle the complete execution path including error recovery.
- **Lesson**: Mock configurations must model the **complete execution path** including error handling and recovery scenarios. When testing transaction rollback behavior, the mock must account for all SQL statements that will be executed, not just the happy path. Incomplete mocks create a structural flaw where tests fail due to mock exhaustion rather than testing the actual application logic. Always trace through the full code path when setting up `side_effect` lists for database operations.

## Test Specification Logic: Incorrect Date Range Mathematics (2025-07-19)
- **Issue**: The test `test_get_price_data_sufficient_data_no_warning` failed with an assertion error expecting 60 rows but receiving 59 rows when filtering data from 2023-01-01 to 2023-02-28.
- **Root Cause**: Test specification error - the test author incorrectly assumed that filtering 60 days of data (2023-01-01 to 2023-03-01) with an end date of 2023-02-28 would return all 60 rows. However, the date range 2023-01-01 to 2023-02-28 mathematically covers only 59 days (31 days in January + 28 days in February).
- **Symptoms**: Test comment stated "Will get all 60 rows" but the specified date range could only return 59 rows, creating an impossible expectation.
- **Fix**: Updated the test expectation from 60 to 59 rows and corrected the comment to reflect the actual mathematical range.
- **Lesson**: Test specifications must be mathematically sound and logically consistent with the data they operate on. When creating date range tests, verify that expectations align with calendar mathematics. Failing tests may not always indicate code bugs - sometimes they reveal logical errors in test design itself. This type of specification error can appear as a "structural issue" but is actually a test design flaw that needs correction at the test level.
    - **Prevention**: Double-check date arithmetic when writing tests involving time ranges
    - **Detection Pattern**: Mathematical mismatches between expected and actual results in date filtering operations
